# Public-Key-Infrastructure

## We have to implement the following modules:
- Implementation of CA.
- Encryption by sender
- Decryption by receiver

We have implemented different module in different python file. There is one
master main.py which first setup CA and public key directory then it sends
message and receive message after that. Readme contains the instruction of
how to run. Each module can be run independently. Run main.py to execute
all modules in sequential.

## How to run

### Run the following in sequence
- python3 CA.py
- python3 sender.py plain vig_key
- python3 reciever.py cipher
 or run the following to execute all 3.
- python3 main.py
